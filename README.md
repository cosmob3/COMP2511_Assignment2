## Part 1 - Re-designing the website (Yossef)

- using the same website from assignment 1.

  - For small-sized devices, your page should be shown in 1 column format. The menu items can be shown vertically

  - For medium-sized devices, you will be using a 2X2 grid in the middle of your page.

  - For large devices, the content should be centered with a fixed size of 790 px, and the remaining spaces on the side (mostly fluid design pattern) should have a plain color of your choice.

    **Note that these are simple sketches, feel free to adjust the sizes and spaces in your design.**

## Part 2 - Website Accessibility (Bryan)

- Document issues you identified in each of the four categories (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust) as discovered through the manual and automated analyses above.
- Describe the kind of changes you made. Donâ€™t just list them; instead generalize the types of issues that you created when building your website, and then describe the generalized type of changes that you made to resolve those issues
